  <p>[Instructions how to use app]</p>
  <p>[Matthew Lee/link to portfolio] created this app to showcase his full stack web dev skills. Boardgame Binder uses SQL,
    Express, Angular, and Node.js </p>
    <h2>Front End</h2>
  <p>Angular 5 template driven forms comprise most of the front-end. Guards and validation are in place to protect routes and
    data injection. Minimal CSS and Angular Material are used, with mobile-first design.</p>
    <h2>Back End</h2>
  <p>The back end uses SQLite because of the
    <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/gabrio/board-games-dataset">dataset source.</a> Three tables are used in this relational DB in order to add boardgames to user's profile.
  </p>

    confirming account creation and "forgot password" ability.</p>
